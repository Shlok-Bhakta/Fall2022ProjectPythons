## Idea

The main goal was to make a game that I could see myself playing for with my friends on [CoolMathGames](https://www.coolmathgames.com) during my Junior High years. I want to have a cool project and I hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜ƒ!

## Gameplay

Itll be a 1v1 (we might do a 1v1v1 and a 1v1v1v1 if we can finish early) with another player, the snake has to eat the fruit that spawns to get bigger. the goal is to make the other snake run into your snake, the other snake to run into itself, or the other snake to run into the wall. The wall will slowly close in from the outside and the first one to die loses. There will be a score system to see who wins the most in a session. I have plans to train an AI using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip). That can also be played against.
